# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
Pewlett Hackard management wants to know how many staff are approaching retirement based on title as well as those who would be eligible for the retirement mentorship program. 

## Four Key Insights: Staff Approaching Retirement Based on Title 

1. A total of 90,398 workers are approaching retirement. 
2. Management should pay special attention to engineering staff, as they make up more than half of upcoming retirements, accounting for 45,397 (50.2%). 
3. We may need to reassess the data considering there are only two managers expected to retire soon, which is a major outlier compared to the other titles where at least 1,000 employees in each category are set to retire. 
4. Unsurprisingly, most roles approaching retirement are from employees likely in management positions, so leadership should consider whom amongst those not approaching retirement would be best to fill supervisory positions. 

## Four Key Insights: Eligibilty for Mentorship Program

1. There are 1,529 staff eligible for the mentorship program. 
2. We may need to review the source data or survey employees again, as the total staff eligible for the mentorship program is significantly lower than the total number of workers approaching retirement -- making up just 1.7% of the 90,398 workers nearing retirement. 
3. Leadership may also want to consider expanding the requirements for the mentorship program to encompass more soon-to-be retirees. 
4. Most of those eligible for the mentorship program are engineers, which reflects that most upcoming retirees hold an engineering title.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

As the "silver tsunami" approaches, we see that a total of 90,398 employees are nearing retirement. Unless Pewlett Hackard is looking to downsize operations for a leaner staff, the company should expect to have to fill in that many roles.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

From our initial analysis, it looks like there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees. However, we should run an additional analysis to anticipate which employees are likely to fill the retirees' roles and confirm if there are enough mentors.
